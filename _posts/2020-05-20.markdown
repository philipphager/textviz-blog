I analysed speeches given by members of the German parliament from protocols published by [OffenesParlament.de](https://offenesparlament.de). In this second post, I analysed the readability of given speeches by topic. I visualized my findings in an interactive graph, depicting the members of parliament and their connection to  specific topics.
