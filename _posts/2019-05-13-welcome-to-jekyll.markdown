I analysed speeches given by members of the German parliament from protocols published by [OffenesParlament.de](https://offenesparlament.de). I used an author-topic model to find 20 different topics and how likely it is that one speaker talks about them (also called topic distribution). I created two interactive graphics you can check out:

1. [Analysing the topic distribution per party](https://philipphager.github.io/textviz-blog/assignments/05/party)

2. [Analysing the topic distribution per member](https://philipphager.github.io/textviz-blog/assignments/05/member/)

Thanks for reading.
